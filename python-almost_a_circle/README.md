# Python - Almost a circle

## Learning JSON, \*args and \*\*kwargs, Serialization and Deserialization

Key Concepts
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
Learn about JSON, its syntax, and how to work with JSON data in Python. Understand how to encode and decode JSON objects, and how to read and write JSON files.

\*args and \*\*kwargs
Explore the usage of \*args and \*\*kwargs to pass a variable number of arguments to functions. Learn when and how to use these special parameters effectively.

Serialization and Deserialization
Dive into the concepts of serialization (converting objects to a byte stream) and deserialization (converting a byte stream back to objects). Understand how serialization is used for data storage and transmission.
